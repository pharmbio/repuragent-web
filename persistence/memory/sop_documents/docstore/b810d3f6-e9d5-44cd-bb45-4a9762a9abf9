Within the REMEDi4ALL project, many of these have been collected, analyzed,prioritized, and brought together on a dedicated website developed for this purpose: https://idrc-r4a.com/landing.\n\nIn this SOP, we use some of these in silico tools and databases to establish a drug discovery repurposing workflow that, starting from an indication, would:\n\nanalyzes pathways and targets possibly associated with such an indication;\n\n\u2022\n\nselects compounds approved by regulatory agencies or in advanced clinical development phases, for other indications that could interact with the repurposed indication targets\n\n\u2022 prioritizes the selected compounds based on known or predicted physicochemical characteristics and/or based on their known or predicted safety events.\n\nThis SOP presents one of the workflows explored during the 1st REMEDi4ALL Hackathon, and a full guideline used for this event is to be found as an annex .\n\n4.2.\n\nInformation on tools and resources\n\nResource name Resource use Link Reactome Pathways https://reactome.org/ OpenTargets Targets https://platform.opentargets.org/ DISGENET Disease-gene associations https://www.disgenet.org/\n\nPage: 2/9\n\nStandard Operating Procedure REMEDI4All-SOPs Page: Version: 3 of 9 01 In silico drug repurposing tools and\n\nresources\n\nValid from:\n\n05.08.24\n\nChEMBL Compounds-targets interactions https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ PubChem Compounds-targets interactions https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/ CompTox Chemicals-toxicity https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboa rd/ ClarityVista Safety analysis https://clarity-vista.com/\n\nProcedure\n\nResearchers worldwide have been studying the interactions of compounds (including small molecules like aspirin or biologicals like vaccines, proteins, antibodies, etc.), with different components of our cells (usually proteins), which are generally called targets. They have incorporated the results of this extensive research into several databases that contain the compounds, their targets, and the diseases (indications) for which they have been studied. For repurposing projects, knowing the compound-target interactions (i.e. how a drug affects a specific component in the cell to produce the desired effect), and the target-disease associations (i.e. the connection between a specific molecule in the cell and a particular disease) is crucial to propose new uses for existing medications.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "b810d3f6-e9d5-44cd-bb45-4a9762a9abf9", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "REMEDI4All_SOPs_In Silico_Repurposing.pdf"}}
