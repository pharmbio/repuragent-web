Compound addition\n\nCompounds (10 \u00b5M i.a. concentration) and controls (amiodarone 10 \u00b5M i.a. concentration; DMSO 0.1 v/v %) are added using the Echo Liquid Handler (Labcyte). Due to requests of the Echo system, attention should be paid to the selected plate types to avoid the plate and transducer crash.\n\nImportant: PhenoPlate = CellCarrier plate in the Echo software\n\n2. Cell seeding\n\nVeroE6 cell line is used for detection of DIPL. Cells are culture in complete medium: DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) supplemented with 10% FBS, 6 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were harvested from a T175 cm2 flask at 80% confluence by washing them once using 10 mL RT PBS and afterwards incubating the cells with 5 mL Trypsin 0.05% / EDTA 0.02 % for 5 min. Cells are suspended using 10 mL of prewarmed cell culture media. VeroE6 cells are diluted to a concentration of 500,000 cells per mL in cell culture media supplemented with 1:1000 diluted HCS LipidTOX\u2122 Red Phospholipidosis Detection Reagent (1000X). 20 \u00b5L of this suspension is added to each well of a 384 well PhenoPlate. Cells are incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5 % CO2.\n\n3. Detection\n\nR4ALL - SOP \u2013 Detection of Drug-Induced-Phospholipidosis\n\nPage: 3/9\n\n4 9 01 15/08/24\n\nCells are fixed by addition of 20 \u00b5L/well 8 % formaldehyde solution. After 30 min incubation time at RT fixation buffer is removed and cells are washed with 50 \u00b5L/well PBS. Cells are stained for 45 min with 20 \u00b5L/well of CellMask\u2122 plasma membrane stain (1:3,000) and Hoechst 33258 (1:10,000) diluted in PBS. Staining solution was removed and cells were washed 3 times with 50 \u00b5L/well PBS.\n\nImportant: Increased fixation-time may result in loss of signal (DIPL spots) and enhanced background.\n\nInduction of DIPL was detected at 0 \u00b5m height of detection with 5 images/well on the Operetta CLS High-Content Analysis System using following parameters.\n\nChannel-name Power Exposure time Alexa 594 60 % 20 ms Hoechst 33258 100 % 20 ms CellMask Deep red 100 % 80 ms\n\nFig. 1. Example of a positive control (left, amiodarone 20 \u00b5M) and negative control (right, DMSO 0.1 v/v %) effect. Nuclei stain using Hoechst 33258, cytoplasm stain using CellMask Deep Red.\n\n4. Analysis\n\nImage analysis is performed using Columbus image analysis software. The analysis includes 5 steps:\n\n- Nuclei identification (Fig.1-A)\n\n- Removement of border objects (nuclei are completely displayed) = \u201cselected population\u201d (Fig.1-B)\n\n- Cytoplasm identification in the selected population (Fig.1-C)\n\n- Calculation of DIPL signal in the cytoplasm (intensity) (Fig.1-D)\n\nIdentification of spots (Fig.1-E)\n\n- Definition of results that should be calculated (Fig.1-F)\n\nR4ALL - SOP \u2013 Detection of Drug-Induced-Phospholipidosis\n\nPage: 4/9\n\n5 9 01 15/08/24\n\naaa ee analysis_spots_selectedmean0S Input Image Find Nuclei -o Channel HOECHST 3325 v | ROI Population None v| ROI Region Method 8 \u00bb lame Output Population Nuclei Comment Select Population Find Cytoplasm Calculate Intensity Properties Find Spots Define Results Sequence Comment Population: Nuclei\n\nA\n\nfat) Ba |g | Input Image Find Nuclei Select Population t= Population Nuclei v Method Remove Border Objects \u00a5 | Common Filter v | a Output Population Nuclei Selected Comment Vv Find Cytoplasm Calculate Intensity Properties Find Spots Define Results Sequence Comment B\u00ae) analysis_spots_selectedmeanoS > \\ Nuclei Nuclei Selected Population: Nuclei\n\nB\n\nR4ALL - SOP \u2013 Detection of Drug-Induced-Phospholipidosis\n\nPage: 5/9\n\n\u2014\u2122.
