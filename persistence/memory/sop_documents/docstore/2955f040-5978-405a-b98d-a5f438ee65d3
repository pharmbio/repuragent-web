{"page_content": "Pathway and target exploration\n\nThe first two questions to be addressed in this workflow are:\n\na. What are the biological pathways associated with the assigned disease?\n\nb. What are the (protein) targets associated with these disease pathways?\n\nTo answer these questions, we first explored the Reactome database (https://reactome.org/) to extract relevant pathways for the disease of interest and identify key proteins or genes within these pathways that could be potential targets for intervention. Additionally, we explored OpenTargets and DISGENET in the following manner:\n\na. Go to the Open Targets platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org/).\n\nb. Search for your disease or condition of interest.\n\nc. Explore the associated targets and their evidence scores. Targets with higher scores are more likely to be relevant.\n\nd. Pay attention to the functional evidence supporting each target.\n\na. Access the DISGENET database (https://www.disgenet.org/)\n\nb. Search for your disease.\n\nc. Explore the genes associated with the disease and assess their relevance as potential targets. DISGENET provides information on gene-disease associations from various sources, helping you identify genes strongly linked to your disease of interest.\n\nThe exploration of these databases will give you an initial list of the targets associated with your assigned disease. Explore this initial list and combine this information with your knowledge of the\n\nPage: 3/9\n\nStandard Operating Procedure REMEDI4All-SOPs Page: Version: Valid from: 4 of 9 01 05.08.24 In silico drug repurposing tools and resources\n\ndisease. You may ask yourself the question: Are the identified targets relevant to the disease or phenotype of interest?\n\nEvaluate the relevance of the identified targets based on the disease context. Consider whether the targets align with known disease pathways, genetic associations, or molecular mechanisms and prioritize the identified targets based on their potential significance in the disease process.\n\na. Combine the information gathered from Reactome, Open Targets, and DiGeNet. Prioritize potential targets based on:\n\n- Consistency across different databases (if a target is implicated in multiple sources, it may be more reliable).\n\n- Strength of evidence (e.g., targets with higher evidence scores in Open Targets).\n\nb. Use your judgment to prioritize targets that are most likely to yield therapeutic benefits, and end with a list of approximately ten candidate targets.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "2955f040-5978-405a-b98d-a5f438ee65d3", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "REMEDI4All_SOPs_In Silico_Repurposing.pdf"}}
