{"page_content": "2 Goal and Area of Application\n\nThis guideline describes the protocol of using high-content imaging to evaluate small molecule- induced phospholipidosis in cells, which might be an undesirable mechanism of action (MOA) of nuisance compounds in cell-based assays. The protocol has been applied for U2OS and A549 cells but can be adapted to other cell lines.\n\n3 Definitions and Abbreviations\n\nHCS High-Content Screening PL Phospholipidosis MOA Mechanism of action PFA Polymeric formaldehyde\n\nPBS Phosphate buffered saline\n\n4 Method\n\nProcedure\n\n4.1\n\nag ef ia] 2 sf MS (3) y Oo = y/ Automated Dispensing and Automated washing HC8&HT imaging spotting incubation and staining\n\n1. Assay-ready plates with pre-spotted compounds were obtained from the Compound Center -20 oC freezer and thawed at room temperature for >1 hr prior to removal of seals.\n\n2. U2OS cells cultured in T175 flask were detached with trypsin upon 70-90% confluency and diluted to 2.7 x 105 cells/mL with media. LipidTox green diluted at 1:1000 in media went through a 0.2 \u00b5m membrane filter and mixed with the cell suspension at 1:1 volume for a final of 1:2000 dilution and 1.35 x 105 cells/mL.\n\n3. The mixture was dispensed by a Multidrop at 30 \u00b5L and 4000 cells per well to the pre- spotted plates. The plates were stacked, covered with wet paper towels, and stored in a plastic box inside of a cell incubator.\n\n4. After 24 hours, cells were fixed by adding 10 \u00b5L of 16% PFA to each well and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS on a plate washer (Aquamax) and incubated with 40 \u00b5L/well of Hoechst (diluted to 2 \u00b5g/mL) and CellMask deep red (diluted at 1:20000) in PBS for 1 hour at 37 oC. The plates were washed again three times and stored in 40 \u00b5L PBS at 4 oC until use.\n\n5. Pre-warm plates at RT for 1 hr. Images were obtained from a fully automated Opera Phenix HCS system.\n\nPage: 2/6\n\nStandard Operating Procedure REMEDI4All-SOPs Page: Version: Valid from: 3 of 6 01 14.02.25 A high-content screening assay to evaluate small molecule-induced phospholipidosis in cells\n\n4.2\n\nOther Sections", "metadata": {"doc_id": "c81d74f0-85af-4152-8456-54f060938ae6", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "REMEDI4All_SOPs_HCS_phospholipidosis_KQ_250210.pdf"}}
