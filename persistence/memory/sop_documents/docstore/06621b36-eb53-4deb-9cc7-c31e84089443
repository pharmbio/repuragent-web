We generated two master plates (MP1 and MP2) containing the drug dilution (definited before) in monoplicate, to be added to cell plate (CP) in duplicate.\n\nThe dilution series of the two drugs will be added to MP1 and MP2. In detail, each point curve will be transferred in MP at a concentration 10 times higher (10X) than the final one to be reached on the cells. The first tube contains the drug at dedicated concentration in a volume that is twice compared to the others, since a serial dilution is performed to obtain 10 points\n\n5\n\nStandard Operating Procedure SOP-R4A-1.1 Page: 6 of 5 Version: Valid from: 1.0 March, 15 2024 Drugs combination screening\n\nfor Drug1 and 9 points for Drug2. Subsequently from each tube 80 \u00b5L are dispensed in 384- MP in monoplicate, as schematized in the example below:\n\nMP1- 10 points diluition curve_Drug1 Vol.1:1 MP1 ee ee ee ee ae ee ra Ta rT 80pL/well 4 MP2-9 points diluition curve_Drug2 Vol.1:1 NON NN NNN 80pL/well \u2014 | | | | SOU YY\n\nThe second MP contains also the negative and positive controls, respectively vehicle (i.e DMSO) and a drug with a known cytotoxic outcome ( i.e. Doxorubicin) which approximate 100% of cell proliferation inhibition.\n\n5.2 Cell seeding\n\nCells are harvested from 75cm2 flask at 80 % confluency by washing them once using 5mL RT PBS (1X), afterwards incubating the cells with 2mL Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37\u00b0C, collecting them in 15 mL falcon by adding medium to neutralize Trypsin activity and centrifuging (5min x 1200rpm). The cells pellet is suspended in 5 mL of prewarmed cell culture media and counted using TC20\u2122 Automated Cell Counter (Biorad).\n\nCells are diluted to a definited concentration per mL (i.e.800 cells/well) (as previously determined in section 4.1) and 32 \u00b5L of this suspension is added to each well cell carrier 384- plate (Revvity). The experimental plate (EP) number is variable depending on the\n\n6\n\nStandard Operating Procedure SOP-R4A-1.1 Page: 7 of 5 Version: Valid from: 1.0 March, 15 2024 Drugs combination screening\n\nexperimental set-up. Just remember to add a plate to measure the untreated T0 (PT0). Cells are incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 .\n\n5.3 Cells status check post-seeding and before the tratemnt\n\nBefore proceeding with the treatment, it will be necessary to assess the proliferative status of the cells. This procedure is essential for subsequent growth rate calculations.\n\nAt the time of treatment (24h after cells seeding), defined T0, a plate for each tested cell line will be assayed by adding 32 \u00b5L of CellTiter-Glo\u00ae reagent (previously diluted 1:1 in milliQ water) to each well and mix for 2 minutes (in the dark) on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis (not included in liquid handling station, manually). The plate is incubated for 10 min in the dark again at RT and luminescence signaling is measured using the Cytation5 micro plate reader (BioTek). The parameters for bioluminescence reding are a GAIN of 135 and an integration time of 0.25\u20131 second per well, as recommended by the protocol.\n\n5.4 Cell Plates treatment\n\nThe drugs from each MP will be added to EP and repeated for n cell plate (EP). In details, a previously determined number of cells/well will be seeded in 32\u00b5l of medium and 24h later 4\u00b5L from every well of each MP will be added to 2 identical CP in order to obtain quadruplicates, reaching a final volume of 40\u00b5L in each well at the end of treatment, as schematized below:\n\n7\n\nAn OF MEDIC|NES\n\nStandard Operating Procedure SOP-R4A-1.1\n\nPage: Version:\n\nValid from:\n\n8 of 5\n\n1.0\n\nMarch, 15 2024\n\nDrugs combination screening\n\nCell Plate _ replicate 1 and 2 1:10 diluition j E E 4pl \u2014\u2014\u2014 MP2 Cell Plate _ replicate 3 and 4 =|\n\n5.5 Read out Measurements and data analysis\n\nThe CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) is a homogeneous method of determining the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay is designed for use with multiwell formats, making it ideal for automated high-throughput screening (HTS), cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cells cultured in a serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.\n\nThe luminescence (lum) is recorded by Gen5 Software. The parameters for bioluminescence reding are a GAIN of 135 and an integration time of 0.25\u20131 second per well, as recommended by the protocol. Finally, the measures from T0 Plate and the experimental plates are exported in excel file for further evaluation.\n\n8\n\n/ WEP OePOSING OF MEDIC |NES\n\nStandard Operating Procedure SOP-R4A-1.1\n\nPage: Version: Valid from:\n\n9 of 5 1.0\n\nMarch, 15 2024\n\nDrugs combination screening\n\n5.6 Quality Control parameters\n\nZ-factor (z-F) , a screening window coefficient, a measure of statistical effect size and calculated as the means (\u00b5) and standard deviation () of both positive (p) and negatives (n) controls:\n\nz-F= 1-3(p+n)/|p-n|\n\nThe coefficient of assay signal dynamic range and the data variation is associated with the signal measurements, and therefore suitable for assay quality assessment.
