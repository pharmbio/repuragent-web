{"page_content": "4 Preliminary Procedures\n\nBefore starting the main procedures, it will be necessary to define, through preliminary experiments, the number of cells and the dosage curve of the drugs tested in combination that must be used in the subsequent experimental procedure.\n\n4.1 Cell number definition\n\nCells are harvested from 75cm2 flask at 80 % confluency by washing them once using 5mL RT PBS (1X), afterwards incubating the cells with 2mL Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37\u00b0C, collecting them in 15 mL falcon by adding medium to neutralize Trypsin activity and centrifuging (5min x 1200rpm).\n\nThe cells pellet is suspended in 5 mL of prewarmed cell culture media and counted using TC20\u2122 Automated Cell Counter.\n\nCells are diluted to allow the seeding of cells in 5 different concentration (usually 1200-1000- 800-600-400 cells/well) in 32 \u00b5L for each well. Each concentration is plated in sixfold on a cell carrier 384-plate (Revvity).\n\n4\n\nStandard Operating Procedure SOP-R4A-1.1 Page: 5 of 5 Version: Valid from: 1.0 March, 15 2024 Drugs combination screening\n\nCells are incubated for 96 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. After 96h (the timing of drug combination screening) of incubation, the number of viable cells plated is analyzed by adding 32 \u00b5L of CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Promega reagent (previously diluted with a 1:2 ratio of milliQ water ) to each well and mix for 2 minutes (in the dark) on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis (not included in liquid handling station, manually). The plate is incubated for 10 min in the dark again at RT and luminescence signaling is measured using the Cytation5 micro plate reader (BioTek). The parameters for bioluminescence reding are a GAIN of 135 and an integration time of 0.25\u20131 second per well, as recommended by the protocol.\n\nThe best cell dosage to select should be higher than 10000 and lower than 1000000.\n\n4.2 Drug dosage curve definition\n\nThis drug combination SOP must be conducted upon dose-response experiments of individual drugs (referr to SOP for IC50 identification). It will be necessary to establish an efficacy curve for the drugs under examination. The experimental curve for each individual drug under examination will encompass an antiproliferative effect ranging from 20% to 80% when administered individually.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "4cec11ea-b781-4254-bf0e-c56359fd7f8f", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "SOP-INT-NA-1_3 Drug combination screening.pdf"}}
