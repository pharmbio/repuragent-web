{"page_content": "Prioritization of selected compounds\n\nThe prioritization of compounds in the list may include those approved of at later stages of development but ideally focuses on those that have reached the market (with Molecule Max Phase=4). More information about approved compounds, or those in clinical phases, in ChEMBL can be found in the link: https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/frequently-asked-questions/drug- and-compound-questions\n\n1. Prioritization of compounds through physicochemical properties exploration\n\nIn this section of the workflow, prioritization of selected compounds is proposed on the basis of the analysis of known or predicted physicochemical properties. As an example, compounds may be prioritized by calculating or measuring their capabilities to cross biological barriers, like the blood-brain barrier for compounds targeting the Central Nervous System.\n\nOne way to assess the ability of the selected compounds (from the list assembled in step 4.3) to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) is by looking at a molecule\u2019s lipophilicity, a physicochemical property often measured by LogP (otherwise known as the partition coefficient).\n\nThe partition coefficient is the ratio of the concentration of a compound in a hydrophobic environment vs. the concentration of that compound in a hydrophilic environment.3\n\n3 ACD/Labs, LogP\u2014Making Sense of the Value, https://www.acdlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/download/app/physchem/making_sense.pdf\n\nPage: 5/9\n\nStandard Operating Procedure REMEDI4All-SOPs Page: Version: Valid from: 6 of 9 01 05.08.24 In silico drug repurposing tools and resources\n\nMany databases will report the XlogP3 metric \u2013 this is simply a method of calculating the LogP of a molecule computationally (rather than experimentally) based on the individual contributions of its constituent atoms.\n\nTo explore the experimental or calculated LogP of the different compounds you can use the following databases:\n\n\u2022 PubChem: PubChem4 is a database that contains millions of chemical compounds, together with some annotated data including interactions with targets.\n\n\u2022 CompTox: The CompTox Chemicals Dashboard5,6,7 provides public access to chemical data. It is a widely used resource for chemistry, toxicity, and exposure information for over a million chemicals.\n\nThe workflow below is a suggested approach to assess blood-brain barrier penetration of your compounds using lipophilicity.\n\nFor each compound in the list generated in step 4.3:\n\n\u2022 Go to PubChem, enter the name and/or ID of your compound.\n\n\u2022 Find the \u201cChemical and Physical Properties\u201d data.\n\n\u2022 Find the XlogP (or XLogP3) value \u2013 record this for each compound.\n\nFor the list of compounds selected for the repurposed indication, the annotations at this stage should include their possible targets, their development phase, and their XlogP values.\n\nWhen prioritizing compounds for repurposing, based on physicochemical properties like the partition coefficient, the following guidance could be used:8,9\n\n\u2022 A drug targeting the central nervous system (CNS) should ideally have a logP value around 2.2.\n\n\u2022 For oral and intestinal absorption, the ideal value is 1.35\u20131.8.\n\n\u2022 A drug intended for sub-lingual absorption should have a logP value >5.\n\n2. Prioritization of compounds through safety exploration\n\nIn this section of the workflow, prioritization of selected compounds is proposed on the basis of known or predicted safety events associated with the selected compounds. There are postmarketing reports of safety events associated with approved compounds that are collected in Spontaneous Reporting Systems databases by regulatory agencies.

These safety events are taken from the Pharmacovigilance reports and recorded in different databases.\n\nOne way to analyze these data is through the software platform ClarityVista that has been developed by the REMEDi4ALL partner Chemotargets10.\n\nClarityVista integrates and curates data from many different databases across the drug discovery and development path, including:\n\n\u2022 Safety pharmacology: how chemical and biologic compounds interact with targets (on targets for efficacy and off-targets for safety)\n\n\u2022 Preclinical Toxicology; toxicology of compounds observed in in vivo experiments with animals", "metadata": {"doc_id": "5da8298d-848d-4aaa-8ca0-3a57fad4276d", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "REMEDI4All_SOPs_In Silico_Repurposing.pdf"}}
