{"page_content": "Identification of stakeholders\n\nThe FAIR-DSM is a questionnaire-based system that enables data owners and analysts to quickly assess the FAIR maturity level of their dataset. The questions cover various aspects of data management, data generation, and legal requirements. Therefore, it is crucial to involve all relevant stakeholders in the evaluation process.\n\nTypically, the stakeholder group includes:\n\n\u2022 Data Managers: Experts in data handling and knowledgeable about the legal bindings related to the data.\n\n\u2022 Data Owners: Individuals responsible for generating the data.\n\n\u2022 Data Scientists: Professionals responsible for downstream analysis of the data.\n\n\u2022 Project Managers or Decision-Makers: Individuals who can provide the long-term vision for the dataset under evaluation.\n\nBy bringing together these diverse stakeholders, the FAIR-DSM ensures a comprehensive evaluation, addressing all facets necessary for improving the dataset's FAIRness.\n\nPre-FAIRification assessment\n\nOnce the required stakeholders have gathered, the next step is to go through the FAIR-DSM questionnaire (https://fairdsm.biospeak.solutions/) and provide answers to the best of their knowledge, keeping the selected dataset in context. The questions are in a multiple-choice format, and selecting the most appropriate answers, or all that apply, is recommended.\n\nSince the questions may contain technical and FAIR-specific terms, helper text is provided for each option to aid in understanding (Figure 3).

Using smart approaches, only questions relevant to the answers provided will be asked, streamlining the process. Overall, this evaluation takes approximately 30-45 minutes. Upon completion of all relevant questions, the FAIR-DSM generates a report that demonstrates the metric for each FAIR Maturity Level. This metric helps researchers identify the current maturity level of their dataset. For instance, as shown in Figure 4, the current maturity level of the dataset might be Level 0. This report can also be downloaded for internal recording.\n\nLevel Representation Content & Hosting Overall Level % & Format Context Environment Completion Capabilities Level 1 67% 100% 100% 86% Level 2 38% 78% 75% 62% Level 3 0% 0% 60% 15% Level 4 0% 0% 67% 14% Level 5 0% 0% 0% 0%\n\nFigure 4: An example of the final high-level report generated by the FAIR-DSM.\n\nR4ALL - SOP \u2013 FAIR data assessment\n\nPage: 5/9\n\n6 9 01 06.01.25\n\nValid from:\n\nAlongside the high-level overview of the current dataset maturity level, the FAIR-DSM provides detailed insights into the criteria that either enable or hinder the dataset's progress towards higher Maturity Levels. For instance, in Figure 5, criteria are color-coded to indicate their status within the dataset: green signifies criteria that are currently satisfied, while red highlights those that are lacking. Achieving all criteria marked in red would elevate the dataset to Maturity Level 1. Furthermore, each criterion is categorized into three dimensions\u2014represented by blue sections\u2014 namely, R (representation), C (content), and H (hosting). These dimensions help researchers pinpoint specific areas within the dataset that require attention to enhance its FAIRness level.\n\nBased on this assessment, 2 indicators still need to be satisfied for your Datasets to reach Maturity Level 1 DSM-1-R2]Structured and/or Unstructured Data are organised into Dataset(s) created for the purpose of FAIR sharing DSM-1-RO]Dataset Metadata is formally represented in the form of an Identifiable Dataset Descriptor DSM-1-R3]A representation of the Dataset Descriptor conforming to a relevant General Purpose Metadata Schema is available DSM-1-R1]Contextual Metadata is reported at summary level and represented in the Dataset Descriptor DSM-1-R4]Dataset Descriptor is available in Machine Readable Format DSM-1-R5]Dataset(s) available in Machine Readable Format DSM-1-CO]Each Dataset purposed for FAIR sharing is assigned a unique identifier DSM-1-C1]Dataset Descriptor includes Descriptive Study/Project-Level summary information DSM-1-C2]Dataset Descriptor includes Identifying & Descriptive Dataset-Level metadata DSM-1-C3]Dataset Descriptor contains access information for the Dataset DSM-1-H1]Metadata hosting environment stores and maintains an identifiable Dataset Descriptor for each identifiable Dataset DSM-1-H2]The Dataset and its Descriptor are indexed and retrievable (in the same or separate hosting environments) via unique and persistent identifiers DSM-1-H3]Retrieval of the Dataset and the Dataset Descriptor utilises a standardized communication protocol that is open, free and universally implementable DSM-1-H4]Metadata hosting environment offers the capability to browse and search contents of the Dataset Descriptor\n\nFigure 5: An example of the maturity level detailed report generated by the FAIR-DSM.\n\nFinally, the pre-FAIR assessment of the dataset is conducted to determine its current maturity level and establish future goals for achieving higher levels of maturity.
