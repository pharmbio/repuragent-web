{"page_content": "1 Goal and Area of Application\n\nThe use of a dose-response matrix allows you to identify and quantify additive, synergistic and antagonistic dose regions in the complete interaction landscape.\n\nThe interaction landscape offers an increased power to differentiate between various classes of drug combinations, and may therefore provide an improved means for understanding their mechanisms of action toward clinical translation.This SOP describes procedures to perform a drugs combination screening assay for cells seeded in 384-well plates in a dose-response matrix experiment.\n\n2 Definitions and Abbreviations\n\nSOP Standard Operating Procedure\n\nCP Cell Plate\n\nMP Master Plate\n\nEP Experimental Plate\n\nRT Room Temperature\n\nDMSO Dimetthyldulfoxide\n\nFBS Fetal Bovine Serum\n\nPBS Phosphate-buffered saline\n\nPT0 plate measured at time 0\n\nLum luminescence\n\n3 Devises, Materials and reagents\n\n3.1 Devises\n\nEquivalent devices can be used, but should be checked to ensure operational condition and suitability for intended use.
