{"page_content": "Selection of compounds interacting with targets\n\nIn this section of the workflow, we address the question: what are the (small-molecule) compounds on the market or in clinical trials associated with the selected targets, and their bioactivities?\n\nIn this step, the goal is to identify all the approved compounds (or those in advanced clinical trials), linked to your list of targets selected in section 4.2. The database proposed to be explored is the ChEMBL database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) .\n\nThe ChEMBL database1,2 is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity, and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs. It is a large-scale, open-access database of bioactive molecules, their targets, and their associated activities. It primarily focuses on small molecules and their interactions with biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.\n\nTo select compounds that interact with the prioritized targets, using ChEMBL, the following workflow is proposed:\n\nFor each prioritized target:\n\n\u2022 Go to the targets area of ChEMBL:\n\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/web_components/explore/targets/\n\n\u2022 Search one of your prioritized targets and filter results e.g. by species to find the best-fitting entry.\n\n\u2022 Click on that best-fitting target to see the entry, there click on \u201cActivity Charts\u201d in the navigation panel, and then on \u201cActivity types for...\u201d above the left-hand chart.

Here, select Molecule Max Phase (column number 22). For ease of view, you can also drag and drop this item to the top of the list. It will appear as one of the first columns in the molecule table. The Molecular Max Phase describes the latest phase of clinical development that the molecule has reached, as indicated by a simple numerical value.\n\n\u2022 A score of 2 tells us the molecule has reached phase II clinical trials.\n\n\u2022 A score of 3 tells us a molecule has reached Phase III clinical trials.\n\n\u2022 A score of 4 tells us a molecule has been approved to treat a condition.\n\n\u2022 For each target in your list, extract the compounds that have a Molecule Max Phase of 2, 3 or 4 \u2013 corresponding to evidence of safety in humans. You can do that by filtering via the filtering pane. Annotate their names and codes and the highest phase the compounds have reached. The results can be downloaded as csv file via the corresponding button.\n\n\u2022 Repeat this process for all your prioritized targets.\n\n\u2022 At the end of this step, a list of compounds that interact with the prioritized disease targets in step 4.2 will be generated. For each compound in the list, additional data like its phase of development, the target, and other information available in ChEMBL will have been collected to support the repurposing hypothesis.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "6f87edb4-fa1a-4578-9d4f-9c6b507fde16", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "REMEDI4All_SOPs_In Silico_Repurposing.pdf"}}
