The compounds were stored in 10 mM DMSO solution and housed at the Compound Center. Four positive controls were provided separately. The empty plates were spotted with 30 nL of compounds each well using Echo 550 (Labcyte), then heat-sealed and stored at -20\u00b0C freezer. A total of 25 plates were obtained for the primary screen, 7 plates for confirmation screen and 12 plates for dose- response screen.\n\nCompound handling: The CBCS annotated library (information available at\n\nImaging plates: 384-well Pheno-plate, black, optically clear flat-bottom, Tissue Culture treated.

Fluorescent dyes: LipidTox green (Invitrogen #H34350), Hoechst 33342 (Sigma #B2261), and CellMask Deep Red (Invitrogen #H32721).\n\n4.4\n\nMeasurements\n\nMeasurements and image analysis were performed on the Opera Phenix HCS system. Measurement settings: the DAPI (blue), GFP (green) and deep red channels were applied to capture signals from Hoechst, LipidTox Green and Cellmask deep red, respectively. Images were taken at four sites in the middle of each well and merged for analysis. Image analysis and data processing: the nucleus was identified from the blue and the whole cell identified from deep red. Then the cytoplasm region was defined from subtracting whole cells with nucleus. LipidTox green stained spots within the cytoplasm region were further identified. Border objects were excluded. Cell numbers were counted from the nucleus\n\nPage: 3/6\n\nStandard Operating Procedure REMEDI4All-SOPs Page: Version: Valid from: 4 of 6 01 14.02.25 A high-content screening assay to evaluate small molecule-induced phospholipidosis in\n\ncells\n\nstaining and used to indicate compound toxicity. Total spot number or total area of green per cell in each well were used to evaluate compound induced PL effect. Image analysis results were saved as csv files and subjected to data analysis in excel. Assay quality control was assessed, using tamoxifen as the positive control and DMSO as the negative control, via the BREEZE platform (https://breeze.fimm.fi/v2/). Primary hits were selected based on PL induction values above the average+3xstd of all samples (excluding controls), while toxic compounds were identified (cell number <80% of DMSO controls). Hits were confirmed in triplicates and dose-response screenings at non-toxic concentrations.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "07974432-fc66-4f97-b576-be44f157f19c", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "REMEDI4All_SOPs_HCS_phospholipidosis_KQ_250210.pdf"}}
