ClarityVista classifies serious side effects using the following scale, in a decreasing order of severity:\n\n\u2022 Signal\n\n\u2022 Warning\n\n\u2022 Reported\n\n10 Learn more about Chemotargets here: https://chemotargets.com/\n\nPage: 7/9\n\nStandard Operating Procedure REMEDI4All-SOPs Page: Version: Valid from: 8 of 9 01 05.08.24 In silico drug repurposing tools and resources\n\nInvestigation of these safety signals and off-target effects for the prioritized repurposing candidates allows to record the side effects that have an alert level of \u201cSignal\u201d for each of the compounds in the list. This level is associated with a statistically significant number of pharmacovigilance reports for a particular side effect.\n\nFinally, having gathered all the information in steps 4.1 to 4.5, the repurposing compound candidates can be prioritized through the assessment of the different variables investigated, analyzing the following questions:\n\n\u2022 What targets do the selected compounds interact with, and could this interaction have a potentially therapeutic effect for the selected indication?\n\n\u2022 What are the physicochemical properties of the prioritized compounds? Could the compound plausibly be delivered to the tissue / organ where it should carry out its effect?\n\n\u2022 What are the off-target effects of the prioritized compounds?\n\n\u2022 What are the major safety concerns of the prioritized compounds?\n\n\u2022 Are the prioritized compounds readily available on the market today, or are they nearing the market, for other indications than the selected repurposing indication?", "metadata": {"doc_id": "637f36cb-2fc1-47c4-a723-6230b37495b3", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "REMEDI4All_SOPs_In Silico_Repurposing.pdf"}}
