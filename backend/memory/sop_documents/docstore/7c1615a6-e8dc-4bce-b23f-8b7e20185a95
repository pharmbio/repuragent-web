Given the complex requirements for FAIR data and its associated metadata, a wide array of tools has been developed to assist, guide, and educate those who are not experts in FAIR principles. Many of these tools are cataloged on the FAIRassist.org platform (https://fairassist.org/).\n\nAmong these tools, we highlight the FAIRplus DataSet Maturity Model (FAIR-DSM) (https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/). Developed within the IMI project FAIRplus, this tool enables the assessment of the FAIR level of a dataset. It offers an exhaustive list of tasks to help users enhance the FAIRness of their datasets in three key areas: content, representation, and hosting environment (Figure 1). By following these guidelines, users can systematically improve the quality and usability of their data.\n\nR4ALL - SOP \u2013 FAIR data assessment\n\nPage: 2/9\n\n3 9 01 06.01.25\n\nHosted by { 1 \u201c<< DESCRIPTIVE & STRUCTURAL METADATA REQUIRENENTS>> -\u2014\u2014\u2014 HOSTING ENVIRONMENT Dataset Descriptor Hosted by STORAGE CAPABILITY RETRIEVAL CAPABILITY SEARCH CAPABILITY Gea ( Noetstoclatd ne } Described by How Dataset & How Dataset & Descriptor || How Dataset & Descrigtor 1 i P Descriptor are stored are retrieved are indexed 2 DSMx}-C-7] nrcarors 3 E & ' | Conforms to Belongs to << Data Reunens> > <<(owermat Meuoan>> Lo | Dataset MODEL Domain MoDeL How the Dataset is \u2018What's included in the represented Dataset ( How the domain model is presented } ( What's reported in the Domain Model ] [SW-2-R2] Loca Mone le a {OSN-3 7] STD MODE SH-x:.\u20ac3 movarons DSM-fe-R1 woicarons DSHL[X]-C1 noicatoRs t [DSM-4-R2] SEMANTIC MODEL REPRESENTATION & FORMAT INDICATORS HOSTING CAPABILITIES INDICATORS\n\nFigure 1: FAIR-DSM domain and infrastructure overview. Figure taken from https://fairplus.github.io/Data-Maturity/\n\nConsidering the three aforementioned dimensions (i.e. Content and Context, Representation and Format, and Hosting Capabilities), the FAIR-DSM assigns a maturity level to the dataset. This maturity level is a metric indicating the ease of data shareability, ranging from 1 to 5. Level 1 indicates minimal potential for data reuse, while Level 5 represents an enterprise-level standard for sharing and reusing data across communities (Figure 2). This systematic approach helps researchers understand and improve the FAIRness of their datasets, ultimately promoting more effective data management and collaboration.\n\nEnterprise Level. Data at this level is optimally managed at the most granular level in an environment offering data Managed Data Assets governance, master data management and reference data management capabilities. Community Level. Data at this level complies with community standard domain models, . Cross-community Level.

Data at this level is identifiable as individual generic Identifiable Data data objects and described by generic metadata elements. Hosting environment offers limited retrieval capabilities.

Post-FAIRification assessment\n\nNomination of a dataset\n\nThe first step in evaluating a dataset's FAIRness level is to identify and nominate a dataset. In this context, a dataset is a collection of files that represent information in a predefined format and capture data within a similar context. This selected dataset then becomes the basis for the FAIR assessment and subsequent improvement steps. Examples of datasets include an Excel sheet containing experimental endpoint results, such as IC50 values for a compound library, or an analysis report in PDF or Word format from an instrument-based analysis.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "7c1615a6-e8dc-4bce-b23f-8b7e20185a95", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "R4ALL_SOP_FairDataAssessment.pdf"}}
