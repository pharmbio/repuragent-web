{"page_content": "Task force establishment\n\nNow that the goals for improving FAIRness have been defined, the next step is to establish a task force responsible for generating and completing tasks aligned with these goals. Typically comprised of data scientists and data engineers, this group possesses expertise in terminologies, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, data models, and web development, among other relevant domains. Their collective knowledge and skills enable them to effectively implement strategies and enhancements aimed at enhancing the FAIRness of the dataset.\n\nAgile-based task sprint\n\nR4ALL - SOP \u2013 FAIR data assessment\n\nPage: 6/9\n\n7 9 01 06.01.25\n\nValid from:\n\nOnce the framework for assigning tasks and identifying responsible individuals has been established, it is beneficial to adopt working sprints akin to the Agile methodology (https://agilemanifesto.org/). A sprint cycle typically spans 2-3 weeks and involves regular (daily or biweekly) updates from task force members. These sprints serve several purposes:\n\na) Establishing Timeline: They clarify the timeline for achieving FAIR goals, ensuring transparency and accountability among team members.\n\nb) Identifying and Mitigating Blockers: They facilitate the identification of obstacles hindering progress and prompt actions to resolve these issues swiftly.\n\nc) Celebrating Success: Sprints provide opportunities to acknowledge and celebrate successful completion of tasks, fostering a positive team dynamic and motivation.\n\nThis structured approach not only enhances efficiency but also promotes collaboration and ensures alignment with the overarching FAIRness improvement objectives.\n\nPost-FAIRification assessment\n\nFinally, upon completion of all planned tasks aimed at achieving the FAIR goals, a post- FAIRification assessment using the FAIR-DSM is conducted. This assessment allows the team to systematically evaluate the extent to which the FAIR goals have been achieved and assess the improvement in the dataset's maturity level following task completion. The post-FAIRification assessment serves several key purposes:\n\nA) It validates whether the set FAIR goals have been met according to the established criteria and standards.\n\nB) It quantifies and qualitatively evaluates the enhancement in the dataset's FAIRness, comparing it to the baseline determined in the pre-FAIR assessment.\n\nC) It identifies any remaining gaps or areas requiring further refinement to achieve higher FAIR maturity levels.\n\nD)\n\nBased on the assessment findings, the team can provide feedback on the effectiveness of implemented tasks and iterate on strategies for ongoing FAIR improvement initiatives.\n\nBy conducting a thorough post-FAIRification assessment, the team ensures continuous enhancement of data accessibility, interoperability, and usability, thereby supporting more robust and impactful research outcomes.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "79a479bb-642b-4dfd-bca8-f36bee6f3c44", "content_type": "CompositeElement", "filename": "R4ALL_SOP_FairDataAssessment.pdf"}}
