'''Cooperative cancellation, so Stop reaches inside a running tool.

Closing the event stream stops the UI immediately and abandons the graph, but it
cannot kill work already inside a synchronous tool: LangChain runs sync tools in a
thread pool and a thread cannot be interrupted from outside. That matters here
more than in most agents — building a disease knowledge graph walks hundreds of
sequential ChEMBL/UniProt/OpenTargets requests, and a CPSign prediction is a Java
subprocess — so "stopped" could otherwise mean the browser goes quiet while the
machine keeps working for another ten minutes.

The contract is deliberately tiny:

* the UI calls `request_cancel(user_id, conversation_id)`;
* long-running tool loops call `raise_if_cancelled()` at a point where abandoning
  the work is safe (top of a per-item loop, between subprocess polls);
* `raise_if_cancelled()` is a dictionary lookup on a `threading.Event` when
  nothing has been cancelled, so it is free to call often.

Nothing depends on cancellation being observed: a tool that never checks simply
runs to completion, and the run is discarded either way.

# --- Making existing loops cancellable ----------------------------------------


def cancellable_tqdm(iterable=None, *args, **kwargs):
    '''A `tqdm` drop-in that checks for cancellation on every item.

    The knowledge-graph and prediction tools already wrap every long loop in
    `tqdm`, because each iteration is a network call. Swapping the import
    (`from backend.utils.cancellation import cancellable_tqdm as tqdm`) therefore
    turns *all* of them into cancellation checkpoints without touching a single
    loop body — and a loop that was not worth a progress bar was not worth a
    checkpoint either.

    The scope is resolved once, when iteration starts, so a worker thread that
    inherited the run's context keeps checking the right conversation.

    Parameters:
    ---------
    iterable (iterable): what to iterate, as `tqdm` takes it.
    *args: passed straight through to `tqdm`.
    **kwargs: passed straight through to `tqdm`.

    Returns:
    ----------
    iterator (generator): the same items, checking for cancellation on each one. Imported *as* `tqdm` in the knowledge-graph modules, so every long loop there becomes a checkpoint without touching a loop body.
