'''Reading and advancing the on-disk execution plan.

These two tools are what replaced the supervisor's prose tracking block. The
supervisor supplies only a step number and a status; the file mutation,
validation, timestamping and the ledger rendered back all happen in code, so
reported progress cannot drift from what actually happened.

The ledger returned by `plan_update` **is** the progress display. Do not add
narration alongside it.

    '''Which conversation's plan file to touch.

    Read from **graph state first**, because that is what `plan_init` used when it
    wrote the file. Tools elsewhere resolve their scope from contextvars, and when
    the two disagree the plan is written in one place and looked for in another —
    which surfaces as `plan_update` reporting "No execution plan exists for this
    conversation yet" while `plan.md` sits there, correctly written. Taking the
    scope from the same source as the writer removes that failure mode entirely;
    contextvars remain as the fallback for a caller outside the graph.

    Parameters:
    ---------
    state (dict): graph state for this run, read before contextvars so the plan is looked for where `plan_init` wrote it.

    Returns:
    ----------
    scope (dict): the `user_id` and `conversation_id` this conversation's plan file is keyed by.

    lives on disk, not in the conversation — so read it whenever you are unsure
    what remains, rather than reconstructing it from the transcript.

    Parameters:

    step number that does not exist comes back as an error naming the valid ones.

    Parameters:
    ---------
    step (int): Step number in the active run, as shown by `plan_status`.
    status (str): One of `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`, `skipped`, `pending`.
