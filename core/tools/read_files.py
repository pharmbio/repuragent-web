'''Reading a text file without pulling a whole dataset into the transcript.

Repurposing runs produce large tables — every candidate drug, every protein,
every ADMET endpoint. Handing one of those to the model verbatim wastes the
context it needs for reasoning and is replayed on every later call in the run.

So a large file comes back as a **preview envelope** — its size, shape, apparent
type, head and tail, plus the two ways to get the rest — and the agent chooses an
access method deliberately: derive the answer with code in `python_executor` when
it depends on the file as a whole, or read one exact region with `offset`/`limit`
when a specific passage is what matters. An explicitly requested line range is
always returned verbatim, never previewed.
