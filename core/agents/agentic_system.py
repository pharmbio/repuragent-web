'''The graph. This is the shape of the whole system.

```
START → task_classifier
  ├ complex   → planning_agent → human_chat ⇄ planning_agent
  │                                   └(approved)→ approval_ack → plan_init
  ├ simple    → plan_init
  ├ follow_up → plan_init
  └ meta_query→ report_agent_meta → context_summary_meta → END

plan_init → execution → plan_finalize → report_agent_{complex|simple}
          → context_summary_{complex|simple} → END

execution (nested subgraph):
  START → supervisor ⇄ {research_agent, prediction_agent, data_agent}
```

Two structural decisions are worth knowing before editing this file.

**The supervisor and its specialists live in a nested subgraph.** A handoff tool
returns `Command(goto=<specialist>, graph=Command.PARENT)`, which *adds* a task
rather than replacing the node's own edges — so a static `supervisor → plan_finalize`
edge fires alongside the handoff and `plan_finalize` runs before any specialist has
done anything (observably: two nodes writing `plan_progress` in one superstep, which
LangGraph rejects). Giving the supervisor no outgoing edge makes the subgraph end
when it stops delegating, and the parent's single `execution → plan_finalize` edge
picks up from there.

**`plan_init` and `plan_finalize` contain no LLM call.** They parse, write and
reconcile `plan.md` in code. That is the point: progress is a file, not prose the
model reproduces.
