'''The five agents, each a thin `create_agent` call.

Every agent is built with `state_schema=AgentGraphState` and a context middleware.
Both are required, for different reasons:

* without the state schema LangGraph filters the parent state down to the plain
  `AgentState`, so `user_id`, `conversation_id` and the plan pointer never reach
  the middleware;
* the middleware is what supplies the output scope, the artifact ledger, the plan
  progress and the compressed history — without it an agent sees the raw message
  list and no idea where it is allowed to write.

Model choice per role lives in `app/config.py`, not here.

    specialist that can read the plan starts working ahead of its brief.

    Parameters:
    ---------
    model (chat model): the model this specialist runs on.
    name (str): the node name, which is also what the handoff tool routes to.
    prompt (str): its role prompt, ending in the `WHAT TO HAND BACK` section.

    yet, because `plan_init` writes it only once the user has approved.
