'''Driving one run and reflecting it in the UI.

This module owns four things that are easy to get subtly wrong:

**The output scope.** It is pinned into an explicit `contextvars.Context` that every
task of the run is created in. `asyncio.Task` copies the ambient context *at
creation*, and the run loop wraps each `__anext__` in a Task so it can race the
file-refresh tick — so a scope merely set inside the streaming generator lives only
in the first task's copy, and from the second event onward every tool call falls back
to `anonymous-user`/`default-thread`. That sent artifacts to a directory the
conversation never reads.

**Stop.** Two things happen, because one is not enough. The event loop breaks and
closes the stream, which abandons the graph mid-run; and a cancellation flag is set
that long tool loops check, because a knowledge-graph traversal already inside a
tool cannot be interrupted from outside — LangChain runs sync tools in a thread pool.
Without the flag, "stopped" meant the browser went quiet while the machine kept
working for another ten minutes.

**Whether this message resumes an approval.** Always asked of the graph, never of
session state. Sending plain input to an interrupted thread makes LangGraph restart
from `START` and re-plan, which used to trap users in an approval loop.

**Runs the user is not watching.** They write into an in-memory buffer flushed on a
timer, rather than a load-rebuild-save round trip per event.
