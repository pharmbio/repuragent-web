'''Driving the graph and turning its output into three UI events.

`stream_langgraph_events` consumes
`astream(stream_mode=["messages", "updates"], subgraphs=True)` and emits exactly:

* **`chunk`** — what a node committed: AI messages, tool calls, tool results.
* **`token`** — partial model text, coalesced. Display-only.
* **`complete`** — the run settled, with whether it paused for approval.

**Why not `astream_events`.** It flattens the graph: every event inside an agent is
labelled `model` or `tools`, so the producing node had to be *inferred* from
metadata strings. `subgraphs=True` supplies the namespace
(`('execution:<uuid>', 'research_agent:<uuid>')`), which makes attribution a
lookup. It also avoids a duplicate-rendering bug: `astream_events` emits a node's
*return value*, which has no id until LangGraph merges it into state, so the UI had
to mint a synthetic id and then failed to match the same message when the parent
re-emitted it with its real UUID.

**Id de-duplication in the timeline is load-bearing, not an optimisation.** A node
wrapping a subgraph re-emits every message that subgraph produced — here the
`execution` node re-emits the entire conversation each time the supervisor commits.
Only id matching stops the transcript from being rendered several times over.
